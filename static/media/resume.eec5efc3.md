# Entrepreneur / Designer / Developer

> I am a Wyoming native, with 18 years of local and regional business experience.  The lines between entrepreneurship and technical proficiency in information technologies are blurring substantially.   I have watched the rapid development of information based technologies, absorbed them to the  best of my abilities to utilize benefits and assisted others in their adoption.  Blockchain and decentralized technologies are the new frontier.

# About Me
*June 17th, 2020*

I have owned and operated small businesses for the last 18 years and my background is in marketing and graphic design. Strong technological knowledge is increasingly becoming a necessity for the operation of businesses and organizations.  With the rapid development of cloud, IT, AI, the gig economy, blockchain and digital asset based solutions, this need will only increase.

I have been fascinated by the complex systems of macro economics, finance, currency, and technology for many years. I find that the developments in the decentralized world combining all of these aspects incredibly exciting and somewhat fortuitous.  My curiosity and mental noodling exposed me to Bitcoin and I have been working my way into the decentralized blockchain space as rapidly as I can.

A persistent love of tech, computers and programming has led me to expand my abilities in development and programming in preparation for the next leg of my career.  I intend on getting to the leading edge of the next evolutionary step in the information based economy, so I can partake in the opportunities that will arise.

My goal is to apply technical blockchain development skills to real world use cases and on-board people to the digital asset space. Spending the last few years self teaching programming; Python, Bash, Docker, Haskell etc, as well as working my way through Udacity's AI for Finance and Blockchain Developer Nanodegrees, I am getting close to the end of this step toward achieving my goals.

On a personal note,  I grew up on a cattle ranch in a tight-knit family environment.  The Robertson's homesteaded in Teton County, Wyoming in 1892.  With a deep love and appreciation for Wyoming and the outdoors,  I spend as much time as I can; mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing and horseback riding with my family.
