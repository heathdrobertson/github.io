__A blog by Heath Robertson where *CodeHappens*__


I grew up on a cattle ranch in remote west central Wyoming. I still live in the small mountain town in where my family homesteaded in the 1890s. I spend as much time in the outdoors; mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing and horseback riding with my family as I possibly can. 

My background is in marketing and graphic design. I have owned and operated small businesses for the last 15 years. As a desinger I have spent time tinkering with my computing systems, both Mac and Linux, and playing with code. 

I have spent the last few years self-teaching programming, from 5am to 7am every day, learning; Python, Bash, Docker, Haskell etc, as well as working my way through Udacityâ€™s AI for Finance Nanodegree and will complete the Blockchain Nanodegree in the near future. 

I have been fascinated by economics, finance, currency, and complex systems for many years. This curiosity and mental noodling exposed me to Bitcoin and I have been slowly working my way in to the decentralized blockchain space. I see tremendouse oportunity in Dapps and DAOs and decentralized trustless systems that will provide humanity options in the rappidly developing information based economy.

A couple of things I am proud of, a happy family with twin boys and I built my own home.
